"""User-Defined Exceptions

    These are custom exceptions created by programmers to handle specific error scenarios in their programs.
    They are not inherently raised by Python but are explicitly raised by the programmer using the raise statement.
    Handling these exceptions is the programmer's responsibility, allowing for customized error management.

Example:

"""


class MyCustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise MyCustomError("This is a user-defined exception")
except MyCustomError as e:
    print(e)

else:
    print("good")

finally:
    print("nothing happened")


"""Built-in Exceptions

    These are predefined exceptions provided by Python to handle common errors such as syntax or semantic mistakes.
    These exceptions are raised automatically by Python when an error occurs during program execution, like a SyntaxError, TypeError, or IndexError.
    Handling these exceptions involves using try-except blocks to ensure the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.

Example:

"""
try:
    x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero raises a built-in exception
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Caught a built-in exception: {e}")
